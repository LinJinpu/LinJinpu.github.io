- Plasma Physics
  - Relativistic Laser-plasma Interactions
  - Wakefield Acceleration
  - Radiation Generation
- Optics
  - Attosecond Science
  - Mid-IR lasers
- High-energy-density Physics
- Physics-informed Machine Learning
- Experimental & Laboratory
  - Control and Diagnostics Systems for High-repitition-rate Experiments
- Quantum Physics
plasma physics, optics & lasers, particle acceleration, radiation generation, high-energy-density physics, and quantum physics. 

Feel free to contact me for discussion or consultance.
